# Goggles

Goggles is a project to convert images into simpler geometric shapes.

Currently, it uses voronoi diagrams to simplify the image. In the future, it _may_ use other techniques as well.

Currently very early stages. Results ain't great. Very slow. And lots of hardcoding. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Improvements:
1. Use multiple threads.
2. Improve efficiency overall.
